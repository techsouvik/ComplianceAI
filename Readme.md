# Compliance AI API

This repository contains the Compliance API, a scalable microservice that takes a website URL and compliance policy URL, analyzes the content of each, and returns any non-compliant findings. Powered by a microservices architecture and advanced AI, this API enables robust compliance checking for diverse applications.

## Features

- **Content Compliance Evaluation**:  Analyzes website content against specified compliance policies.
- **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Enables horizontal scaling to handle large workloads.
- **Advanced Content Processing**: Uses Google's Generative AI model to generate and interpret complex compliance findings..
- **Modular Architecture**: Follows microservice and MVC architecture for easy scalability and maintenance.
- **No Database**: The project does not require a database, with data retrieved directly from the product pages.
- **Logging**: Utilizes Winston for logging errors and info-level logs to files.

## Services

### Browser Service

This service handles the navigation to the product page using Puppeteer, fetches the HTML content, and cleans it by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., scripts, images, pop-ups).

```javascript
fetchPageContent(url) → { html, metadata }
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `url`: The product page URL.
- **Returns**: 
  - Cleaned HTML content and metadata (title and description).

### LLM Service

This service sends the cleaned HTML and metadata to an LLM API to dynamically identify the CSS selectors for the review section and pagination.

```javascript
identifyCssSelectors(html, metadata) → { selectors }
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `html`: Cleaned HTML content.
  - `metadata`: Page metadata (e.g., title and description).
- **Returns**: 
  - CSS selectors for review container and pagination.

### Scraping Service

This service uses the CSS selectors provided by the LLM Service to extract the reviews. It also handles pagination, ensuring all reviews across multiple pages are retrieved.

```javascript
extractReviews(html, cssSelectors) → [reviews]
handlePagination(html, cssSelectors, url) → [reviews]
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `html`: HTML content of the product page.
  - `cssSelectors`: CSS selectors for extracting reviews and pagination.
  - `url`: Product page URL (for pagination).
- **Returns**: 
  - A list of reviews from the page(s).

## Environment Variables

| Variable   | Description               | Default |
|------------|---------------------------|---------|
| `PORT`     | The port on which the API runs | `3000`  |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | llmService uses Gemini 1.5 flash Model | `LLM configuration` |

You can create a `.env` file to manage environment-specific configurations.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Puppeteer**: For headless browser automation to fetch page content.
- **Redis**: For inter-service communication and queue management.
- **Cheerio**: For parsing and querying the HTML.
- **Winston**: For logging.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.

---

## Logging

This API uses the **Winston** logging library for logging errors and info-level messages to both console and files.

- **Combined log**: Captures both info and error messages (`combined.log`).
- **Error log**: Captures only error messages (`error.log`).

By default, logs are written to the root directory of the project.

---

## Error Handling

The API is designed to handle common errors, including:

1. **Invalid URL**: If the product page URL is not valid or inaccessible, an error message will be returned.
2. **Failed CSS Selector Identification**: If the LLM fails to identify the correct CSS selectors, the API will return a failure response.
3. **Pagination Errors**: If pagination fails, the current page's reviews are returned along with an error log.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to retrieve reviews"
}
```

---

## Future Improvements

- **LLM Service Integration**: Replace the mock LLM service with a live LLM API for CSS selector identification.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages for better debugging and clarity.
- **Support for Additional Review Platforms**: Expand compatibility to handle more e-commerce platforms and custom websites.
- **Storing Data in a Database**: Implementing a database which further stores the cssSelectors for a given website which can later used a cache before requesting the LLM

- **Containerisation**: Implementing Docker and composing it to make an image which will be easy to use
